##About Code
In this code we have implemented the concept of authentication and authorization by using the components of authentication like
- Claims
- ClaimsIdentity
- ClaimsPrincipal

The UI will be having a navigation menu consists of Home, About, Members, and Login.

First, Users could able to login if you are a member of the site.
If you want to access the members tab, You must first login to see the content available in members page.
To do the above scenario, We have used [Authorize] attribute for the Members method in HomeController.
If the user either enter wrong username or password, an error message will be generated and displyed on the web page.
